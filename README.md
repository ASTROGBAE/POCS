# Overview

[PANOPTES](http://projectpanoptes.org) is an open source citizen science project that is designed to find exoplanets with digital cameras. The goal of PANOPTES is to establish a global network of of robotic cameras run by amateur astronomers and schools in order to monitor, as continuously as possible, a very large number of stars. For more general information about the project, including the science case and resources for interested individuals, see the [project overview](http://projectpanoptes.org/v1/overview/).

POCS (PANOPTES Observatory Control System) is the main software driver for the PANOPTES unit, responsible for high-level control of the unit. There are also files for a one-time upload to the arduino hardware, as well as various scripts to read information from the environmental sensors. 

# Getting Started

POCS is designed to control a fully constructed PANOPTES unit.  Additionally, POCS can be run with simulators when hardware is not present or when the system is being developed.

For information on building a PANOPTES unit, see the main [PANOPTES](http://projectpanoptes.org) website.
