# PANOPTES Environmental Analysis System (PEAS)

The weather and other environmental factors can impact
quality of observations.

Each PANOPTES unit is equipped with a bunch of sensors that
measure wind speed, ambient temperature, humidity and much more.

This repository contains the software that reads the sensors
on each PANOPTES unit, and prepares data for analysis in
Google BigQuery.
