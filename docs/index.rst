Welcome to POCS's documentation!
================================

`PANOPTES <http://projectpanoptes.org>`_ is an open source citizen science project that is designed to find exoplanets with digital cameras. The goal of PANOPTES is to establish a global network of of robotic cameras run by amateur astronomers and schools in order to monitor, as continuously as possible, a very large number of stars. For more information, including the science case, see the `project overview <http://projectpanoptes.org/v1/overview/>`_.

POCS (PANOPTES Observatory Control System) is the main software driver for the PANOPTES unit, responsible for everything but the image analysis (see `PIAA <https://github.com/panoptes/PIAA`_) and the small electronics (see `PACE <https://github.com/panoptes/PIAA>`_)
