[PANOPTES](http://projectpanoptes.org) is an open source citizen science project that is designed to find exoplanets with digital cameras. The goal of PANOPTES is to establish a global network of of robotic cameras run by amateur astronomers and schools in order to monitor, as continuously as possible, a very large number of stars. For more general information about the project, including the science case and resources for interested individuals, see the [project overview](http://projectpanoptes.org/v1/overview/>).


POCS (PANOPTES Observatory Control System) is the main software driver for the PANOPTES unit, responsible for high-level control of the unit.
